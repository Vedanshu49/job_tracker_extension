# Privacy Policy for AppliTrack

**Last Updated: November 26, 2025**

AppliTrack is a browser extension designed to help users organize and track their job search. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.

## 1. Data Collection

AppliTrack accesses and collects the following data only when you explicitly interact with the extension (e.g., by clicking "Apply", using "Save" features, or entering information manually):

* **Job Details:** Job title, company name, job description, application URL, and other job-related information visible on the job board.
* **User Input:** Notes, application status (applied, interview, offer, rejected, etc.), interview details, and any other information you manually enter.
* **Application Metadata:** Application date, salary information, location, and other relevant job details.

This data is collected by accessing the visible content of job board websites (such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Internshala, and other supported platforms) strictly for the purpose of organizing and managing your job search locally.

## 2. Data Storage

**All data is stored locally on your device.**

We use the browser's `chrome.storage.local` API to save your applications and related information. Your data:
* Never leaves your browser
* Is not transmitted to any external server, database, or cloud service
* Is not shared with any third-party services or analytics platforms
* Is not used for any purpose other than displaying and managing your job applications

## 3. Data Usage

The data collected is used solely for:
* Displaying your complete job application history and status in the dashboard
* Generating personal analytics and statistics (e.g., "Jobs Applied vs. Offered", "Application Trends")
* Creating local calendar events (.ics files) for interview dates at your request
* Generating email drafts (mailto links) for follow-ups at your request
* Organizing and filtering applications by various criteria (status, company, date, etc.)
* Providing reminders and notifications about upcoming interviews or follow-ups

## 4. Permissions Used

AppliTrack requests the following browser permissions:
* **activeTab:** To access content on job board websites where you activate the extension
* **scripting:** To extract job information from the current web page
* **storage:** To save your data locally in the browser
* **Host Permissions:** To access specific job board websites

These permissions are used exclusively to help you capture and organize job application data.

## 5. User Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:
* **Access:** You can view all your data anytime through the extension dashboard
* **Export:** You can export your application history for personal backup or reference
* **Deletion:** You can delete individual job applications via the dashboard
* **Complete Removal:** You can clear all data by uninstalling the extension or using the clear data feature in the settings

## 6. Data Security

Your data security is important to us:
* Data is stored locally using browser storage APIs with built-in browser security protections
* No data is transmitted over the internet
* Your data is only accessible by you through the AppliTrack extension
* Uninstalling the extension will remove all associated data from your browser

## 7. Third-Party Services

AppliTrack does not:
* Use any third-party analytics services
* Share data with external services
* Use tracking cookies
* Collect any information beyond what is explicitly described in this policy
* Sell or share your data with any third parties

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
